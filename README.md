# Clojure & Datomic sample code

I struggled finding reasonable tutorials to learn how to use datomic with clojure. Eventually I came across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao7xEwCjrWQ) video. This repo is the source code created by following its steps, except for the end where we go from beyond an in-memory datomic store to a real datomic store.

Special thanks to [Misophistful](https://github.com/Misophistful) for recording the tutorial. All credit goes to him, not me.
